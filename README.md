Top 10 Cryptocurrencies of February 2024 Getty

From Bitcoin and Ethereum to Dogecoin and Tether, there are thousands of different cryptocurrencies, making it overwhelming when you’re first getting started in the world of crypto. To help you evaluate the best crypto to buy, these are the top 10 cryptocurrencies based on their market capitalization or the total value of all the coins currently in circulation.
Best Crypto To Buy Now
1. Bitcoin (BTC)

    Market cap: $846.0 billion

Created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency. As with most cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a blockchain, or a ledger logging transactions distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Because additions to the distributed ledgers must be verified by solving a cryptographic puzzle, a process called proof of work, Bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters.

Bitcoin’s price has skyrocketed as it’s become a household name. In May 2016, you could buy one Bitcoin for about $500. As of Feb. 6, 2024, a single Bitcoin’s price was around $43,118. That’s a growth of 8,524%.

2. Ethereum (ETH)

    Market cap: $281.4 billion

Both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform, Ethereum is a favorite of program developers because of its potential applications, like so-called smart contracts that automatically execute when conditions are met and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Ethereum has also experienced tremendous growth. From April 2016 to the end of February 2024, its price went from about $11 to around $2,342, increasing 21,189%.

3. Tether (USDT)

    Market cap: $96.1 billion

Unlike some other forms of cryptocurrency, Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other cryptocurrencies, and it’s favored by investors who are wary of the extreme volatility of other coins.
4. Binance Coin (BNB)
